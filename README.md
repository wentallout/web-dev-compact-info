0. Design Theory:
You need to think like a designer, yeah YOU, you think a frontend dev doesn't need to know about beautiful designs? WRONG.
Colors:
TOOLS: 
colorhunt.com 
flatuicolors.com --> iOS
materialpalette.com --> ANDROID
ColorZilla: pick colors for you in your browser.

Look at your project and think strongly about what people feel when they use it, different shades = different moods.
TIPS: Learn from ads, if you see an ad that's related to your project, maybe the colors they're using is good. If a color is too intense, people might not look at it for too long
- RED: love, energy, intensity, fast cars, love-related, underwear??, manipulation, seduction
- YELLOW: joy, intellect, attention grabbing.
- GREEN: freshness, safety, growth, food-related stuff, healthy food?
- BLUE: stability, trust, serenity, medical-related stuff, you want to look more trustworthy --> just go blue in an interview
- PURPLE: royalty, wealth, feminity, loan company, women-related stuff, I actually don't like this
COLORS WHEEL THEORY: 
- Analogous: next color to the color you pick in the wheel --> harmonious, plesant to look at for a long time but not attention grabbing
- Complementary: opposite color in the wheel --> extremely standout, grab your attention, WARNING: usually not good for UI
- Split colors: basically a 3 colors palate, great for icons, logo, standout but not CLASHY
- Triadic: balanced, attention grabbing, overused in the 90s (haha) --> DATED
- Monochromatic: use the same COLORs in the wheel (red with this shades + another red with another shades) --> VERY MODERN, VERY GOOD.
Typography: harmony is the key, you want to make your fonts work TOGETHER, getting a pretty font doesn't mean anything, you need to know what to pick, how to use it to show contrast and grab people's attention
main problem: there are way too many FONTS, what the hell do I pick?
SERIF: conservative, old looking (ex: Didot)
Slab-Serif: You don't want to use this, trust me.
For modern websites: you should only care about sans-serif


1. CSS:
Units (px, em, rem, vh, vw): THERE IS NO BEST. some people argue that you should never touch px but the truth is sometimes you must use it (ex: you need a border that has a fixed size no matter what). you mainly use rem for FONTS, vh and vw are pretty cool, it scales to the viewport. rem is good for pretty much any situations. (an old trick: use font-size: 62.5% in html)


- FLEXBOX
- GRID

2. Typescript:
- This thing is an absolute game changer in web development (mainly because Javascript is garbage), you don't know it? you already lost. Learn this if you want a long term career. You can even type normal javascript inside it?
Strong Typing + Object Orientated + Better Intellisense + Access Modifiers + Future Javascript Features + Catch dumb mistakes in development (typo) + 3rd party libraries + Easy to learn if you know JS.
- Annoyances: More codes, some libraries don't have Typescript, Strict mode
