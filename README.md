1. Typescript:
- This thing is an absolute game changer in web development (mainly because Javascript is garbage), you don't know it? you already lost. Learn this if you want a long term career. You can even type normal javascript inside it?
Strong Typing + Object Orientated + Better Intellisense + Access Modifiers + Future Javascript Features + Catch dumb mistakes in development (typo) + 3rd party libraries + Easy to learn if you know JS.
- Annoyances: More codes, some libraries don't have Typescript, Strict mode
