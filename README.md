0. Design Theory:
You need to think like a designer, yeah YOU, you think a frontend dev doesn't need to know about beautiful designs? WRONG.
Colors: look at your project and think strongly about people's emotions when they use it, different shades = different moods.
TIPS: Learn from ads, if you see an ad that's related to your project, maybe the colors they're using is good. If a color is too intense, people might not look at it for too long
- RED: love, energy, intensity, fast cars, love-related, underwear??, manipulation, seduction
- YELLOW: joy, intellect, attention grabbing.
- GREEN: freshness, safety, growth, food-related stuff, healthy food?
- BLUE: stability, trust, serenity, medical-related stuff, you want to look more trustworthy --> just go blue in an interview
- PURPLE: royalty, wealth, feminity, loan company, women-related stuff, I actually don't like this
COLORS WHEEL THEORY: 
- Analogous: next color to the color you pick in the wheel --> harmonious, plesant to look at for a long time but not attention grabbing
- Complementary: opposite color in the wheel --> extremyly standout, grab your attention, WARNING: usually not good for UI
- Split colors: basically a 3 colors palate, great for icons, logo, standout but not CLASHY
- Triadic: balanced, attention grabbing, overused in the 90s (haha) --> DATED
- Monochromatic: use the same COLORs in the wheel (red with this shades + another red with another shades) --> VERY MODERN, VERY GOOD.
Typography: harmony is the key, you want to make your fonts work TOGETHER, getting a pretty font doesn't mean anything, you need to know what to pick, how to use it to show contrast and grab people's attention


1. CSS:
- FLEXBOX
- GRID

2. Typescript:
- This thing is an absolute game changer in web development (mainly because Javascript is garbage), you don't know it? you already lost. Learn this if you want a long term career. You can even type normal javascript inside it?
Strong Typing + Object Orientated + Better Intellisense + Access Modifiers + Future Javascript Features + Catch dumb mistakes in development (typo) + 3rd party libraries + Easy to learn if you know JS.
- Annoyances: More codes, some libraries don't have Typescript, Strict mode
